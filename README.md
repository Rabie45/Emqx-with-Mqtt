## Whats is mqtt?
 - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. It is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications due to its simplicity and efficiency.
Key Features of MQTT:

    Lightweight: MQTT is designed to be lightweight both in terms of bandwidth usage and implementation complexity. This makes it suitable for devices with limited resources, such as sensors and embedded systems.

    Publish-Subscribe Architecture: MQTT uses a publish-subscribe messaging pattern where clients (devices or applications) can publish messages to topics. Other clients can subscribe to these topics to receive messages.

    Quality of Service (QoS): MQTT supports different levels of QoS to ensure message delivery reliability:
        QoS 0 (At most once): The message is delivered at most once or not at all.
        QoS 1 (At least once): The message is delivered at least once, ensuring no message loss but may result in duplicates.
        QoS 2 (Exactly once): The message is delivered exactly once by using a handshake mechanism to confirm delivery.
